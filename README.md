This dataset was cleaned from the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) "*ml-latest-small*" dataset, which was released by the GroupLens. It is meant to help build recommendation algorithms, like the ones you see in Netflix or Spotify. The GroupLens organization has other ratings datasets, too, on music, jokes, and books.
