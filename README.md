## movies_merged.csv

This dataset was cleaned from the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) "*ml-latest-small*" dataset, which was released by the GroupLens. It is meant to help build recommendation algorithms, like the ones you see in Netflix or Spotify. The GroupLens organization has other ratings datasets, too, on music, jokes, and books.

## airline_products_2017.csv

The data are taken from the Airline Origin & Destination Survey (DB1B) but has been substantially cleaned by Dennis McWeeny, a Senior Economist at Bates White Economic Consulting.

The data contain information on a sample of airline itineraries for flights departing from one of seven airports in the San Francisco Bay region and arriving at one of the other large cities in the United States in the second quarter of 2017. Each observation contains information on the origin airport, destination airport, airline, nonstop or connecting itinerary type, average one-way fare in dollars, and distance between the origin and destination (in miles).
